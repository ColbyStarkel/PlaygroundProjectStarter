The one bug I have found in the game football is that when ever a player moves their character into the goal it counts as a goal.
This could be fixed if the characters you play as could some way be programmed to not be able to go into any of the walls.
The goal is the only part that can be entered but it should only be able to be entered by the ball. 
When fixed the ball will be the only thing that can go into the goal and therefore count as a goal.
